Must have knowledge on these concepts to crack any DE interview:

## I. SQL

- Aggregate functions - AVG, MIN, MAX, etc.
- Joins - important! types of joins and their output.
- Window functions - Ranking functions, LAG, LEAD

### Concepts to Understand:
- **CTEs**: What are they, how do they work, how to create them, and why are they used. Pros and cons.
- **Views, Materialized Views**: Their usage, creation, and benefits.
- **Index**: Types of indexes, understanding the index behind the scenes.
- **Partitioning**: Types of partitioning and their significance.
- **Normalization / Denormalization**: Their importance and relevance in database design.

## II. Data Warehousing (DW) and ETL

- **Star vs Snowflake Schema**
- **DB vs DW vs Data lake**: When to use each appropriately.
- **Choosing Columnar vs row oriented Databases**
- **Facts, Dimensions**: Understanding and examples.
- **Steps to implement a Data warehouse**: For example, in BigQuery.
- **Best practices for DW, reporting**
- **Slowly changing dimensions**
- **Handling duplicate records, inconsistencies in data**
- **Understanding ETL vs ELT process**: Data cleaning, ingestion techniques.

## III. Spark

- **Understanding Architecture**
- **YARN basics**
- **Sparkcontext, session, worker, task, job, stage, etc**
- **Spark DataFrames, actions, transformations, reading and writing data, specifying schema options**
- **Repartitioning vs Coalesce**
- **Partioning**
- **Handling OOM error in Spark**
- **Broadcast variables, broadcast joins**
- **Best practices of Spark, best tuning practices**
- **Different persisting strategies in Spark**

## IV. Cloud Experience

- **Most commonly used services in Cloud for Data systems**
  - AWS: S3, Redshift, Glue, RDS
  - GCP: Cloud Storage, Bigquery, CloudSQL, Dataflow (for streaming)

## V. Linux Skills

- Basic Linux skills are crucial.

## Other Skills to Learn:

- **Orchestration tool**: Airflow (slowly becoming a must-have skill)
- **Streaming data**: Spark Streaming / Flink
- **Pubsub systems like Kafka**
- **NoSQL databases**: MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, etc.
- **System Design for Big Data**
